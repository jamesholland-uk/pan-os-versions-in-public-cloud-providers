# Base PAN-OS Images on Cloud Service Providers

This project exists to track the versions of base PAN-OS images which are present within major Cloud Service Providers. The list of versions is retrieved and parsed directly from the Cloud Service Providers via their APIs. Other cloud-specific details are also made available where applicable, including AMI IDs for AWS base images for example.
